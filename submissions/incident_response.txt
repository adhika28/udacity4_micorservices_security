1. Incident commander name:
High CPU Resource Utilization due to Illegal Crypto-Mining Activity

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods running three different crypto miners were launched in the production cluster.
The attacker was able to get control of the cluster and run these containers on the cluster.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker managed to run crypto miners on our system, which cause massive increase of CPU utilization.

4. Summmry of the impact:
High CPU resource spike can slow down other containers on the same node, and can even cause Kubernetes core components like kubectl, the control panel, and kube-proxy to become unresponsive.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
Evict the cryto-mining pods using command: kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>
Verify the CPU metric on Grafana Dashboard.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
Use admission controllers to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods.
Enhance CPU monitoring dashboard and also the alert.
Update the priority of Falco rules for the metrics endpoint to the highest level.
